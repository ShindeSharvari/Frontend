  <p><bold>Contrary to popular belief</bold>, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <i>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC</i>, making it over 2000 years old. <mark>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source</mark>. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br>The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. <del>Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero</del> are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
